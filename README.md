# The Hive Skill

The Hive Skill is an open-source multi-agent orchestration skill for agentic coders. It turns one AI coding agent into a structured six-role council: Queen, Scout, Architect, Forger, Sentinel, and Scribe.

The Hive Skill is built to be invoked once and trusted to continue until the task is completed, validated, or blocked by a clear stop condition.

v0.2.0 provides a disciplined orchestration protocol with structured handoffs, evidence requirements, bounded repair cycles, and explicit stop conditions. Real multi-model execution depends on the runtime.

## Demo

The Hive Skill turns one AI coding agent into a six-role autonomous dev council: Queen, Scout, Architect, Forger, Sentinel, and Scribe.

## Supported Runtimes
- OpenCode / OpenCode Go
- Claude Code
- Codex
- Generic `.agents` workflows

## Installation

### 🔗 Marketplace

```powershell
/plugin marketplace add yuzuruu29/the-hive-skill
/plugin install hive-mind-council@the-hive-skill
```

### Recommended: HTTPS installation

Use HTTPS for public installs on Windows. The repository is public, so you do not need a GitHub SSH key, and this avoids SSH host-key verification errors.

```powershell
npx skills add https://github.com/yuzuruu29/the-hive-skill.git --yes --global
```

Use `--global` when you want the skill available across projects. The Skills CLI installs to your user directory with `--global` and to the current project by default without it.

### Interactive installation

Use this when you want to review the installation prompts before anything is written.

```powershell
npx skills add https://github.com/yuzuruu29/the-hive-skill.git
```

Omit `--yes` when you want to keep the install interactive.

### Local installation

```powershell
npx skills add https://github.com/yuzuruu29/the-hive-skill.git --yes
```

Use this when you want the skill installed for the current project only. The Skills CLI uses the current project scope by default, while `--global` installs to your user directory for use across projects.

### SSH installation for advanced users

```powershell
npx skills add git@github.com:yuzuruu29/the-hive-skill.git --yes --global
```

SSH requires Git to be installed, a GitHub SSH key to be configured, and GitHub to be present in your local `known_hosts` file.

### Troubleshooting: Host key verification failed

```powershell
ssh-keygen -R github.com
ssh -T git@github.com
```

When `ssh -T` prompts you to trust GitHub's host key, type:

```text
yes
```

Then retry the installation command.

`Host key verification failed` means Git could not trust GitHub's SSH host identity.

`Permission denied (publickey)` means the host is trusted, but your SSH key is missing or not configured correctly.

Public users should use the HTTPS installation command instead of configuring SSH unless they specifically need SSH.

## Autonomous by Default

The Hive Skill is designed to run as an autonomous loop.
You do not need to manually ask it to plan, code, validate, and summarize. Invoke the skill once, give it the goal, and it will continue through the council loop until the goal is completed, validated, or blocked by a clear stop condition.

Example:
Use The Hive Skill to fix the failing login flow.
The skill will automatically:
1. Inspect relevant files.
2. Find the likely cause.
3. Plan the smallest safe fix.
4. Implement the change.
5. Run validation.
6. Fix validation failures.
7. Produce a final report.

## Token Efficient by Design

The Hive Skill avoids unnecessary context usage by default.
It uses:
- Targeted file inspection
- Compact role outputs
- Minimal planning overhead
- Reused findings
- Short state summaries
- Focused validation loops

This makes it practical for long coding sessions and agentic tools with limited context windows.
